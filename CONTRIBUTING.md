### Reporting bugs

* Before reporting a bug, please to check the [existing issues](https://github.com/finiteadventures/es6-jekyll-skeleton/issues) to see if the problem that you have been observed has been previously reported.
* Describe the behavior you expected and the actual behaviour you observed.
* Include the browser, browser version, OS, OS version and device where you experienced the problem.
* Include screenshots and / or other supplementary material, whenever relevant and possible; they are very helpful.
* If possible, check the browser's Javascript console and report any errors that may be associated with the problem you have observed.
* If you can, include a unit test (see the [Spec Styleguide](#spec-styleguide) below for details) that shows how the expected behaviour is not occurring. This can be included as part of the issue description, or as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).

## ES6 Styleguide

Coming soon!

## SCSS Styleguide

Coming soon!

## Spec Styleguide

* Write informative, well-structured [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) unit tests.
* Name specs according to the following convention: '*.spec.js'.
* Place specs in a `spec` folder of the feature/module you are working on, if present.
* Feel free to create a `spec` folder when specs for a feature/module, become sufficiently numerous.
* If a method is private method of a class, it does not strictly require unit testing.
* Treat `describe` as a noun or situation (often the name of class or method).
* Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.
* For instructions on how to to run specs, see information on the project's grunt tasks in our [README](https://github.com/finiteadventures/es6-jekyll-skeleton#grunt-tasks).

### Example

Sample code to be tested:

```es6
class Cat {
  constructor (mood) {
    this.mood = mood || 'sleepy';
  }

  make_noise() {
    if(this.mood === 'sleepy'){
      this.purr();
    } else {
      this.miaow();
    }
  }

  miaow() {
    # code for miaowing here
  }

  purr() {
    # code for purring here
  }
}
```

Sample spec:
```es6
describe('Cat', => {
  describe('#make_noise', => {
    describe('when the cat is sleepy', => {
      it('should purr', => {
        # spec here
      });
    describe('when the cat is not sleepy', => {
      it('should miaow', => {
        # spec here
      });
    });
});
```
