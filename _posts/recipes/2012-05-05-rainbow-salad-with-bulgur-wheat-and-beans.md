  title: "Rainbow Salad with Bulgur Wheat and Beans"
  meta:
    preparation-time: 20 minutes
    cooking-time: 15 minutes
    yield: 4 - 6 portions
  notes:
    - I call this simple wholesome salad "Rainbow Salad", because it has ingredients of (almost) all the colours in the rainbow. It makes a great lunch, snack or side salad, and keeps well for several days in the fridge.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 cup (200 g) bulgur wheat
        - 1 400 g can (240 g drained - about 1⅓ cups) red kidney beans
        - 2 medium carrots, sliced in half circles
        - 125 - 150 g (~ 1 cup) green beans, sliced in thirds
        - 200 - 250 g (1½ - 2 cups) cherry tomatoes , halved - or 3 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped
        - ½ medium red onion (~ ½ cup), finely chopped
        - ¼ cup (40 - 50 g) raisins or sultanas
        - 2 tbsp (20 g) pine nuts
        - ¼ cup fresh coriander leaf, roughly chopped (optional)
        - Lemon slices (optional garnish)
    dressing:
      title: Dressing
      ingredients:
        - 1 heaped tbsp wholegrain mustard
        - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
        - 3 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar
        - ½ tsp salt
        - A generous grinding of pepper
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Steam the green beans and carrots, taking care not to overcook them. (If you prefer your veggies in a raw untarnished state, feel free to omit this step.) Be sure to remove the steamed vegetables from the heat while they still retain a little bite. Before you set them aside, if you wish, you may rinse the vegetables in some cold water to ensure they do not cook further in their residual heat.
        - Cook the bulgur in 1½ cups boiling water over a low heat. When all the water has been absorbed, set it aside.
        - Using a colander, drain and thoroughly rinse the red kidney beans. Prepare the onions, tomatoes and coriander and place them in a large salad bowl with the raisins, pine nuts and red kidney beans.
        - Whisk the dressing ingredients together in small jar. Add the dressing to the salad bowl and toss it with the other ingredients until they are completely coated.
        - Finally, add the steamed vegetables and bulgur, and gently toss the salad once more, until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Do not worry if the carrots and bulgur are still warm at this point; this salad is great either warm, room temperature or cold.
        - Serve and enjoy!
  variations:
    - Use couscous in place of the bulgur. Other grains might be nice too... What about quinoa, brown rice, or even orzo? Feel free to experiment and tell me about the results!
    - Replace the red kidney beans with another bean of your choice. I recommend chickpeas. Fried or grilled cubes of tofu might also be a delicious alternative.
    - Add some feta or mozzarella cheese. This can be added as an extra on top of all the normal ingredients, or in place of the kidney beans, if you're not a bean lover.
    - "Try any or all of the following: Replace the green beans with lightly steamed broccoli. Substitute steamed sweet potatoes or butternut squash for the carrots. Use 2 - 3 scallions in place of the red onion."
    - Replace the pine nuts with another nut or seed of your choice. I recommend pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds or sliced almonds.

This is one of those recipes that started out as a "What can I make from what's left in the kitchen?" kind of creation, but has evolved into one of my go-to dishes when I'm looking for a simple healthy meal. It's quick to prepare and keeps well in the fridge, which makes it perfect for lunches or snacks. I love having a grain based salad, like this one, ready and waiting in the fridge. It's perfect for when I need a quick pick-me-up or a no-fuss, healthy meal.

As its name suggests, this salad is packed full of a veritable rainbow of ingredients: nutritious beans, sweet carrots, refreshing tomatoes, tangy onions, crunchy pine nuts and raisins (extra sweetness) - and of course, bulgur wheat. Over the last while, I've developed something of a small obsession with bulgur - I love its chunky grains, so hearty and nutty flavour. I love how all the subtle flavours of this salad are tied together by the bulgur, and I hope that you do too.

This dish is so simple to prepare that you really can't go wrong. Here are one or two tips that will make your time preparing it even easier. Firstly, do be sure to add the dressing to the salad BEFORE the bulgur and steamed veg have been added (as described in my instructions below). This salad becomes more difficult to stir after their addition, and it can be tough to fully incorporate the dressing without risking mushing up all your beautiful cherry tomatoes. Secondly, while you can mix your dressing separately in a jar before adding it to the salad (as described below) - it is also perfectly fine to add the dressing ingredients individually to the salad and combine it all in situ. This is what I do when I'm feeling especially lazy - or I don't feel like having an extra dish to clean.

If you just scroll down to the recipe below, you'll see a whole host of variations you can experiment with. I've tested most of these at one time or another, and have never been disappointed. One variation I would recommend in particular is replacing the green beans with broccoli. In fact, the first time I made this recipe I used broccoli - and have probably made it far more often with broccoli than green beans. I just always seem to have some broccoli knocking around at the back of the fridge.

I thought it was worth mentioning, for anyone on a tight budget, this is a happily cheap dish to prepare, especially if you replace the pine nuts (which are quite overpriced in my local supermarket) with a more affordable seed or nut, use normal tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes and omit the fresh coriander (or grow your own). I always try to be conscious of how much I'm spending on food - it's comforting to have some staple recipes that are both wholesome and easy on the pocket.

Now all that's left is to answer the inevitable question, where oh where is the blue in this rainbow salad?  Well, don't worry my friends, I have been deeply pondering this question, and though it is no mean feat thinking up blue ingredients, I'm prepared to present a few solutions. For a truly rainbow salad, the adventurous (or rainbow loving) among you should consider the following additions: blueberries (dried or fresh), blue corn or blue potatoes. As for me, I'm usually happy chowing down on almost all the colours of the rainbow, but if I ever do test out a blue ingredient in this salad, I'll be sure to let you know.
