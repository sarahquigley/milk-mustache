  meta:
    preparation-time: 10 minutes

    - "Adapted from Better Home and Gardens: Mexican Cook Book, published in 1977."
    - Picadillo is a Latin American meat dish. This version is a subtly sweet Mexican variation with nuts, apples and raisins. It makes an excellent tortilla or taco filling or can be served over rice. This particular picadillo recipe is something special... I've tried restaurant versions of picadillo and always been sorely disappointed!
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 pound (450 g) lean minced beef or pork
        - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
        - 2-3 cloves garlic
        - 500 g (18 oz) passata (tomato puree)
        - 1 medium apple, peeled, cored and chopped
        - 1/2 cup raisins
        - 1/4 cup slivered almonds
        - 1/4 cup chopped parsley (optional)
        - 1 tbsp vinegar
        - 1 tsp sugar
        - 1 tsp salt
        - 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
        - 1/4 tsp ground cumin
        - 1/8 tsp ground pepper
        - Olive oil
  method:
    - In a medium-sized pot over a medium heat, fry the onions and garlic in a little olive oil. When the onions begin to turn translucent, add the beef and cook until brown. At this stage, if necessary, pour away any excess fat. Stir in all the remaining ingredients. Cover the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes.
    - Serve over rice, or as a tortilla or taco filling.
  variations:
    - For a delicious vegetarian (and vegan) version of this dish, simply replace the meat with 1 pound of cooked red kidney beans (or another bean of your choice).

I hate to pick favourites, but this picadillo recipe may be my favourite Mexican dish. Scratch that - It might just be be one of my favourite dishes of all time. This meat dish is subtly sweet and packed with apple, raisins and almonds. Yum! I'm a big fan of adding a little fruit to savoury dishes, which may be part of why I have a special love for this recipe...

Picadillo is made throughout Latin America, and every region seems to have its own unique version. This recipe is an old family favourite... the page of the old 1977 Better Homes and Gardens: Mexican Cook Book it comes from is splashed and stained from use. Picadillo always brings back memories of the enormous Mexican spreads my mother prepared for my family during my childhood. These were fill your own tortilla or (taco) affairs, with two or three Mexican dishes and whole array of toppings - chopped tomatoes, grated Cheddar cheese, spinach or lettuce, home-made guacamole, chopped red onion, hot sauce, and, on an indulgent day, sour cream. Of the dishes made for these spreads, picadillo was always my absolute favourite... always the one I would beg my mother to cook.

When I make picadillo, I like to follow my mother's example and serve it with a selection of toppings (how many depends on how fancy I'm feeling) and warmed tortillas - I recommend you do the same! This time around, I topped the picadillo quite simply, with freshly grated cheddar cheese, chopped tomatoes and lettuce. To make things a little special, I went all out and prepared home-made tortillas and a side-dish of Spanish rice. My flour tortilla recipe is still in need of some refinement... they tasted decent, but I was hoping for even better and it was tough to roll them as thin I would have liked. (Try again. Fail again. Fail better.) The Spanish rice recipe on the other hand is another old family recipe, which I'll be sharing with you all soon. 

If flour tortillas aren't your thing, picadillo is also excellent as a taco filling or served over rice (nice alternatives if you're following a gluten-free diet.) I've read it's great for filling tamales too... though I've never tried that myself. This is a very quick and easy dish to prepare... no more difficult than making a bolognese. Picadillo isn't just for meat eaters. I've made an absolutely delicious vegetarian (and vegan) friendly version of this dish many times previously by subsituting beef with red kidney beans.

You might be wondering about the mustachioed cocktail stick flag boldIy flying above this tortilla castle. It just so happens that I think food is better with a flag, but there's another far more important explanation for this special garnish. Three months and a thousand and one suggestions later, I am overjoyed to announce that I've finally found an identity that feels right for this little corner of the internet. This flag was created to celebrate that new identity. I'm very pleased to welcome you to Milk Mustache, a bright little recipe blog celebrating the joy of eating! Get your mustaches on and celebrate with me by making yourself a Mexican feast... Don't forget the picadillo!
