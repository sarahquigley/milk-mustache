  method:
    before-preparing-the-cake:
      title: Before Preparing the Cake
      steps:
        - Preheat oven to 175ºC (350ºF).
        - Butter two 23 cm (9 inch) round pans. Line the base of each pan with baking paper, butter the paper and, finally, flour the pans.
    prepare-the-cake-food-processor-method:
      title: Prepare the Cake Batter (Food Processor Method)
      steps:
        - In a large measuring jug, combine cocoa powder, buttermilk, water and vanilla extract, and set aside.
        - Measure flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into the food processor bowl, and process for 2 seconds. Set this mixture aside for later use.
        - Place sugar and eggs in the food processor bowl, and process for 1 minute, stopping once in the middle to scrape down the bowl.
        - Add butter to the processor bowl, and process for another minute, again stopping in the middle to scrape down the bowl.
        - With the machine running, slowly pour the reserved buttermilk mixture through the machine's feed tube, and process for another 20 seconds.
        - Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the reserved flour mixture.
        - Mix the flour mixture into the batter by pulsing the machine 5 - 6 times (or until the flour has just disappeared), stopping to scrape down the bowl before the final pulse. Do not over-process the batter at this point.
    prepare-the-cake-alternative-non-food-processor-method:
      title: Prepare the Cake Batter (Alternative Non Food Processor Method)
      steps:
        - Measure dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt) into a bowl, mix and set aside.
        - In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time.
        - In a large measuring jug, combine buttermilk, water and vanilla extract. Beat into the butter, sugar and egg mixture.
        - Finally, stir dry ingredients into the mixture until they have disappeared. Avoid overmixing at this stage. 
    bake-the-cake:
      title: Bake the Cake
      steps:
        - Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes (or until a toothpick inserted into cake's centre comes out clean).
        - Cool the cakes for 5 minutes in the pan, then invert them on to wire racks, removing them from their pans. Allow the cakes to cool completely before decorating.
        - Once the cake has cooled...
    prepare-the-buttercream-icing:
      title: Prepare the Buttercream Icing
      steps:
        - Measure icing sugar, cocoa powder and salt into the food processor bowl and process for 5 seconds.
        - Add butter, vanilla and 2 tbsp sour cream and process until smooth.
        - If you prefer a softer creamier frosting (as I do for this cake), the remaining sour cream can be added to adjust the consistency of the icing.
    prepare-the-glaze:
      title: Prepare the Glaze
      steps:
        - In a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the butter and chocolate, and stir them together.
    assemble-the-cake:
      title: Assemble the Cake
      steps:
        - Place the first layer of cake on your favourite cake platter.
        - Spread the buttercream icing evenly over the top of this layer, and gently place the second layer on top.
        - Pour the chocolate glaze over the cake. Using a metal spatula, butter knife or back of a spoon, smooth it thickly over the top of the cake.
    to-decorate:
      title: To Decorate
      steps:
        - To decorate with finger biscuits, smooth a thin layer of glaze over the sides of the cake. Before this sets, press finger biscuits gently around the cake, alternating between dark, milk and white chocolate fingers.
        - If omitting the finger biscuits, glaze the top of the cake only, or prepare extra glaze the sides of the cake (2.5 - 3 times the given recipe). 
        - If you wish, garnish top of cake with chopped chocolate and / or small chunks of leftover finger biscuits.
  variations:
    - "Simplify: This chocolate cake recipe is delicious enough to stand on its own (without icing and glaze) as a simple dessert. Halve the cake recipe to make a single round layer. Once baked, dust the cake with a little icing sugar and serve with ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream."
    - "Buttercream it: For a sweeter, less sophisticated cake, forget the glaze and double the amount of buttercream icing instead. Use the extra icing to ice the top (and sides if you wish) of the cake. Great for children!"
    - "For parties: Bake the cake as a single 32.5 x 23 cm (9 x 13 inches) baking pan. Keep the cake as a single layer, and ice the top of the cake with a double recipe of chocolate buttercream icing. Cut the cake into cubes and share!"
    - "Be adventurous: Find alternative decorations for the top and sides of your cake!"

This is the recipe I turn to when I want to impress, seduce, or otherwise bake my way into people's good books. It is the death-by-chocolate cake that every chocolate cake lounging languorously behind the glass of cafe counters promises to be, but so rarely is.

Let me tell you about the cake... two layers of chocolate bliss, sandwiching a layer of soft chocolate buttercream icing, topped with a fudgy dark chocolate glaze. The cake is surrounded by alternating dark, milk and white finger biscuits, an idea I spotted at a wedding I attended, and couldn't resist trying myself. The finger biscuits turned out to be a great idea... they are an incredibly fuss free way to create a special looking cake.

One key to this dessert's success (and any culinary adventures for that matter) is good ingredients: real butter (unsalted is best), golden caster sugar and natural vanilla extract for the cake - high quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa content) for the glaze. Having recently relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, I've been struggling to find a North American equivalent for golden caster sugar. My best recommendation is to use the finest grain Turbinado sugar you can find. Less essential, but still nice: if you can get your hands on golden icing sugar, your chocolate buttercream icing will have a deeper flavour. However, golden icing sugar can be difficult to find (and ridiculously over-priced) - your icing will still be delicious without it.

Speaking of ingredients, with my new Vancouver home, I've had the opportunity to test some of my best recipes in a new location. Shock and horror: many of them are not quite as tasty when prepared here, as they were back in Ireland! Currently I suspect that differences arise from the lower of fat content of North American butter (I miss you Irish butter). Differing flour densities may also be a factor. I'm a little worried that this cake (which I haven tested in North America) will suffer from similar problems. Before I made this move across the ocean, I wasn't aware that it was important to localise recipes for locally available ingredients. I plan to do some testing to figure out how to compensate for ingredient differences in this recipe and others. I'll let you all know the results.

This cake is prepared using Abby Mandel's food processor method, which I couldn't recommend more highly. Not only have I have found that this method produces exceptionally light, moist cakes, but it is quick and easy. One of this method's unusual aspects is that that eggs and sugar are processed together first, and then butter is added. In contrast, conventional cake preparation has butter and sugar creamed together first, before adding eggs. It's worth noting that those of you without a food processor can still make this cake: Simply follow the conventional order for mixing butter, sugar and eggs. In the future, I will be posting a detailed piece about the food processor cake method, with step-by-step photos guiding you through the full procedure. Hopefully this will clear up any uncertainties anyone may have about trying the method for themselves.

This cake has been in baked in my family for long enough that it qualifies as an old family recipe. My mother would bake it for me as a kid (my brother didn't like chocolate cake, weirdo), and I would do helpful things like weigh ingredients and lick the food processor bowl (cleaning!). The usual family version of this cake is somewhat simpler... this cake minus the chocolate glaze and fancy finger bisuit decoration, instead iced top and sides in buttercream icing. I've baked this simple version dozens of times for the storytelling and baking event I founded in Dublin, Milk and Cookie Stories. Beware... serving this cake to a crowd is dangerous business.

Now for the recipe! Have fun with it... Make it your own. Find someone special to bake it for... Do a chocolate dance.
