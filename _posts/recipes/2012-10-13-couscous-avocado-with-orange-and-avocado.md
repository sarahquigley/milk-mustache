Let's talk about orange and avocado - two foods just begging to be served together, and yet before I accidentally created this salad from the dregs of my larder, I never knew.  Orange's sweet tanginess is the perfect counterpoint for the creaminess of avocado. I've fallen in love with this pairing, and have been spending my spare moments dreaming of new dishes to try it out in.

What about the salad that started it all? Orange and avocado, of course, cucumber for crunch, hearty red kidney beans and fluffy couscous, dressed in a honey orange vinaigrette... This salad is light and fresh - perfect for a simple wholesome lunch, a palette cleansing side dish -- or, if you're a weirdo like me, an unusual breakfast. 

There's nothing very complicated about preparing this salad. I have one piece of advice: avoid cutting the avocados until everything else is chopped, the dressing is made, and the couscous is cooked and ready to go - that way you'll enjoy the avocado at its very best. Mushy brown avocado is never a very appetising proposition.

This dish is best served freshly made. Though it can be stored for a day or so in the fridge, the cucumbers lose their crispness and the avocados inevitably brown. If you wish to make this salad in advance, I would advice omitting the cucumber and avocado, and adding them at the last minute, shortly before serving.

Go forth and have salad! Have this salad. It's healthy, easy on the wallet - but much more importantly, it's fluffy, zesty, creamy and crunchy all at once.
